TED Talk View Prediction
Overview
The TED Talk View Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate the number of views a TED Talk will receive. TED Talks are renowned for their inspiring and informative content, and predicting the number of views can help speakers, organizers, and the TED community understand the impact and reach of each talk.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a wide range of features related to TED Talks, including the speaker's occupation, the topic of the talk, the length of the talk, the number of languages it's available in, and more. Additionally, the dataset includes the actual number of views each talk has received, making it ideal for supervised learning.

Techniques Used
The TED Talk View Prediction model leverages supervised machine learning techniques for regression. The primary techniques employed include:

Data Preprocessing
The dataset undergoes data cleaning and feature engineering to handle missing values, transform categorical variables, and create new features that may influence the number of views.

Feature Selection
Selecting the most relevant features from the dataset is crucial for building an accurate prediction model. Advanced feature selection techniques are utilized to identify the key factors that significantly impact the number of views.

Model Selection
Various regression algorithms are considered, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. Each model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine the best-performing one.

Model Evaluation
The final predictive model is thoroughly evaluated using cross-validation techniques and additional evaluation metrics. The accuracy of the model's predictions is assessed against the actual number of views for TED Talks in the test dataset.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed (listed in requirements.txt).
Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and preprocess the dataset.
Execute the view_prediction_model.py script to train and evaluate the predictive model.
Analyze the model's performance using the generated evaluation metrics and assess its effectiveness in predicting TED Talk views.
Contributions
Contributions to this project are highly encouraged. If you have ideas for enhancing the model's accuracy or suggesting new features, your contributions can significantly improve the TED Talk view prediction model.
